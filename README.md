<h1>Introduction/h1>
Welcome to YelpCamp! Jump right in and explore our many campgrounds.
Feel free to share some of your own and comment on others!

§ The YelpCamp is a tool for helping users reserve camping spaces. Moreover, the user may also
introduce their camping spot to others by creating their own campsite on the web. For each campground
page, it will include the campsite’s information: pictures, the location, the price, and the owner's name.
§ The website was designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the authority section was built with
Node.js and Cookies, and the database was MongoDB.
§ VSCode, GitHub, Cloudinary and Heroku are sources to implement and keep track of the data and
process of this project
